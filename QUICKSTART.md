## Essential Features

### Pattern Bank

- **01-16 buttons** = 16 pattern slots
- **SAVE** = Store current pattern
- **MAGIC** = Load a random pattern (instant inspiration!)
- **CLEAR** = Empty a slot

### Transport Controls

## Pro Tips for Advanced Features

### Parameter Locks (P-Locks)

1. Press **[P]** button above a step
2. Change the engine or parameters
3. That step will now use those specific settings
4. Gold color indicates P-locked steps

**Use case**: Make one kick deep, another punchy

### Slide Locks (S-Locks)

1. Press **[S]** button above a step
2. The sound will smoothly transition to the next step's parameters
3. Red [S] indicates slide is active

**Use case**: Pitch sweeps, filter glides

### Step Conditions

1. Click the **1:1** label below any step
2. Select a condition (like **1:2** = every other bar)
3. Creates evolving patterns over multiple bars

**Use case**: Add fills every 4th bar

### Sound Morphing

1. Click **GENERATE** in Sound Morph section
2. Move the slider to morph between current and random
3. Click **LOCK** when you find something good
4. FX stay the same, only synthesis changes

**Use case**: Subtle variations without starting from scratch

### Save Your Work

- **SAVE JSON** = Export everything (patterns, settings, everything)
- **LOAD JSON** = Import a saved preset
- **EXPORT PATTERN** = Save just one pattern
- **IMPORT PATTERN** = Load a single pattern

## Common Workflows

### Start from Scratch

1. Click **MAGIC** for instant pattern
2. Adjust which steps are active
3. Change engines and parameters
4. Add effects
5. **SAVE** to pattern slot

### Build a Complex Beat

1. Create basic pattern in slot 01
2. **COPY** to slot 02
3. Select slot 02, modify it
4. Use step conditions to alternate between variations
5. **SAVE JSON** when done

### Sound Design Session

1. Pick one track
2. Try all 10 engines
3. Use **GENERATE** to explore random parameters
4. Use **SET NORMAL** to save favorite
5. Create P-locks for variations

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Currently all mouse-driven, but you can:
- Tab through controls
- Enter to activate buttons
- Arrow keys to adjust sliders

## Troubleshooting

**No sound?**
- Click anywhere first (browser security)
- Check computer volume
- Try refreshing the page

**Sounds weird?**
- Try different engines
- Reset parameters to default
- Use **RECALL NORMAL** if you saved one

**Patterns disappeared?**
- They're stored in browser memory
- Use **SAVE JSON** to back up
- JSON files can be loaded later

## Next Steps

1. Explore all 10 synthesis engines
2. Try the MAGIC button for inspiration
3. Experiment with step conditions for longer patterns
4. Use P-locks for dynamic variations
5. Chain patterns using the 16 slots
6. Save your best work as JSON
